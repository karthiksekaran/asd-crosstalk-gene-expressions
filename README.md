The main objective of this study is to understand the gene expression alternations in autism spectrum disorder cases. It's evaluated by experimenting with the comparison groups.

It contains three comparison group, (Age matching control, Healthy mother with ASD children and Age matching healthy mother with no ASD children and no past history of ASD) with equal
sample size on every group (n=21)

Interestingly, no significance found between ASD vs Healthy mother with ASD children, represents higher similarity among their gene expression patterns.

Most of the genes are downregulated. Further details can be found in the manuscript, which is under submission.
